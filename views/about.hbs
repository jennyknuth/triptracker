The BVSD Trip Tracker Program

Who we are:​

Welcome to Trip Tracker, the program that encourages and rewards students for walking, biking, carpooling and riding the bus to school.  We are entering our fifth year and thrilled to be making a difference.


How to participate:​

Parents register their children on this website and download monthly calendars to keep track of their trips back and forth to school.  At the end of the month, families receive an email for each registered student asking them to report their total number of trips for the month via a simple survey (available on the website).  We crunch the numbers and deliver boxes of Trip Tracker Dollars to each school to be distributed by parent volunteers to trip tracking students.

 About those Trip Tracker Dollars:
We have over 60 participating businesses and organizations that accept Trip Tracker Dollars like cash.  The businesses include, book stores, toy shops, sporting goods stores, ice cream shops, rec centers, restaurants and an amusement center (mini-golf, go-carts, etc.).  Trip Tracker buys those dollars back from the businesses at 50 cents on the dollar.  Our first year was supported by three businesses that are still with us today --- Spruce Confections, Gateway Fun Park, and The Bookworm.​​


​*Trip Tracker funding comes to us in part by a grant administered by the Denver Regional Council of Governments. DRCOG also brings the WaytoGo carpool networking program that is currently in place in all of our BVSD schools.​
